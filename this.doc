The keyword This is determined by how a function is called based on the following context
Global,Object/implicit,explicit,new

Global- refer to the global window object(everything declared in a global context is in the
        windows object).
        use "use strict" to prevent accidently create global variables
        using strict in objects
                Examples 3.

Object/Implicit-Used inside a function that is inside an object
                .This will be bind to that object
                Example 2.

Explicit-use Call/Apply/Bind for outside of an object.these methods will allow us to
        bind to any object.
                Example 3.


  Call  = thisArg,a,b,c,d..  invoke immediately
  Apply = thisArg,[a,b,c,d]  invoke immediately
  Bind  = thisArg,a,b,c,d    invoke at a later time(use with ASYNC).
                              bind(this)saves selected as object to be called later;

New-this can be use if the key word "new" is used to create a constructor function
              Example 4.

the new keyword
  -creates an empty object
  -sets the keyword this to be that empty object
  -it add the line "return this" to the end of the functions that follows it
  -it add property onto the empty object called "_proto_", which links
    the proptotype property on the constructor function to the empty object
Javascript does not have class support so the new keyword constructor functions
are used to replace it.
  Blueprint are classes
  Objects are instances
    example 1.

Prototype,_proto_


-Closure exists an inner function make use of a variable declared from the outer function
which has previously returned
-We can use closures to create private variables and write better code that isolate
our logic and application
